# plotly_deploy

## Project Overview
I will be using Plotly.js, a JavaScript data visualization library, to create an interactive data visualization for the web. I will be:
  - Creating basic plots with Plotly, including bar charts, line charts, and pie charts.
  - Use D3.json() to fetch external data, such as CSV files and web APIs.
  - Parse data in JSON format.
  - Use functional programming in JavaScript to manipulate data.
  - Use JavaScript's Math library to manipulate numbers.
  - Use event handlers in JavaScript to add interactivity to a data visualization.
  - How to use interactivity to enhance your visualizations.
  - Deploy an interactive chart to GitHub Pages.

## Resources
- Data Source: plots.js, index.html, samples.json
- Software: HTML, VS Code, JavaScript, Plotly.js

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge, I will be completing the belly button dashboard and deploy a working version to GitHub Pages.

The goals for this challenge are:
  1. Create a bar chart of the top ten bacterial species in a volunteer's naval. Use JavaScript to select only the most populous species.
  2. Create a bubble chart to visualize the relative frequency of all the bacterial species found in a volunteer's naval.
  3. Complete the demographic information panel.
